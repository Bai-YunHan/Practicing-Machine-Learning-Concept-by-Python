For all the classifiers below, there are publicly available software libraries that  implement some versions of these classifiers. However, implementing the algorithms with your homemade code will help you understand it better. 

1. Beta-Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes.
3. Logistic Regression.
4. KNN.
